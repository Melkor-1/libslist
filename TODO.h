/* TODO: Either make it a circular list. Or use a different struct
*		 that keeps track of the head and tail pointer, and the lenght 
*		 of the list. It would make counting O(1).
*		 Or make a doubly linked lists. It will make insertion and
*		 deletion trivial.
*		 Add an ll_apply function that does something specific to all the nodes.
*		 Add a ll_sort function that sorts the link list in ascending/descending order.
*		 Add two functions for qsort to sort ascendingly/descendingly.
*		 Consider using a bitfield as the second argument of the sort functions, where
*		 valid options can be:
*		 1) LL_DESCEND 2) LL_ASCEND 3) LL_REVERSE
